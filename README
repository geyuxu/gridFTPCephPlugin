This provides a gridFTP plugin to access ceph data stores.

It builds with cmake and will create a libglobus_gridftp_server_ceph.so file to be used when launching the server.
Something like : /usr/sbin/globus-gridftp-server -dsi ceph -allowed-modules ceph

In order to define which ceph pool, userId and layout should be used, on should define the environment variable GRIDFTP_CEPH_DEFAULTS with a string in format [<userID>@]pool[,nbStripes[,stripeUnit[,objectSize]]]

Current known issues :
  - in principle, paths can also be prepended with a similar string and a ':' to modify this default file by file. But this is currently broken (see next point for why)
  - paths that do not start with '/' get a slash appended in the server as they are considered relative.

To get better (acceptable) read/write performance, set the parmeters GRIDFTP_CEPH_READ_SIZE and GRIDFTP_CEPH_WRITE_SIZE in the gridftp.conf file.
